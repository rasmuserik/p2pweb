title: A Blockchain Computer

abstract: |
  We propose a design for a new decentralised trustless computer. By storing the machine state in the blockchain, it is possible to securely run distributed computations, without trusting the individual nodes. Individual nodes only need to know/store the small subset of the blockchain that they need for their computation.
