  year={2008},

  abstract={At present, the probability of selecting "the peer next door" as an overlay neighbour in Kademlia is fairly small. Prior research has been concerned with reducing the lookup latency by means of proximity neighbour and route selection, but focused on recursive routing algorithms. This work leverages location data about peers and extends Kademlia's iterative routing algorithm to reduce cross-network traffic at the level of the distributed hash table. Evaluation with real-world measurement data gives evidence that locality of traffic tends to reduce lookup latencies as well. In turn, mechanisms that aim at reducing lookup latencies do not necessarily reduce cross-network traffic to the same extent.},

  abstract = "Implementation of a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) overlay network directly on the realistic network environments is not a feasible initiative as scalability is a major challenge for P2P. The implementation of newly created P2P networks must be analyzed, well tested and evaluated through experiments by researchers and organizations. Various simulators have been developed to analyze and simulate P2P protocols before applying to real applications. However, selection of an appropriate simulator suitable for a given application requires a prior comprehensive survey of P2P simulators. The existing literature survey of P2P simulators has limitations viz. (i) all P2P related simulators have not been included, (ii) all design criteria for comparison and appropriate selection of the simulator may not be considered, (iii) appropriate practical application through the simulation has not been presented to enhance the outcome of a survey. To overcome these limitations, we survey existing simulators with classifications, additional design parameters, limitations and comparison using various criteria. In addition, we discuss about common interface concept that creates a generic application to make the implementation of targeted application portable. Not only that, we present a case study of implementation of BATON (BAlanced Tree Overlay Network) and BATON* using an event-driven model of PeerSim simulator that helps the developers to simulate the tree overlays efficiently."

First described by Satoshi in 2008, it is the first example of a computer that has the functionality to remember and enforce past statements by participants, in a non-localized, resilient and auditable manner. Although the Internet has allowed us to create a global infrastructure for cheap and flexible communication, no strong statements can follow from its weak economic signals without resorting to a recognised authority. A global information system that has the properties of the Internet but also the functionality to enforce statements without a trusted intermediary is required: such a system is called trustless. The chapter follows the examples of the usage of blockchain technology as a system that provides guarantees over the rules of its operations in consumer goods, online dating and international trade, with no need of third party intervention for the creation of trust, unleashing new potential business opportunities.",
