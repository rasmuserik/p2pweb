## HashAddress

Hashes as addresses, and utility functions for Kademlia-like routing.

**Parameters**

-   `o`  

### dist

xor-distance between two addresses, - with 24 significant bits, 
and with an offset such that the distance between `0x000..` 
and `0x800...` is `2 ** 123`, and distance `0b1111..` and 
`0b1010111..` is `2**122 + 2**120`. 
This also means that the distance can be represented 
within a single precision float. (with some loss on least significant bits)

**Parameters**

-   `addr`  

### distBit

index of first bit in addr that is different.

**Parameters**

-   `addr`  

### flipBitRandomise

Flip the bit at pos, and randomise every bit after that

**Parameters**

-   `pos`
