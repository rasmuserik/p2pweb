abstract="The wide variety of small, computationally weak devices, and the growing number of computationally intensive tasks makes it appealing to delegate computation to data centers. However, outsourcing computation is useful only when the returned result can be trusted, which makes verifiable computation (VC) a must for such scenarios.",

year={2008},
pages={343-350},
abstract={At present, the probability of selecting "the peer next door" as an overlay neighbour in Kademlia is fairly small. Prior research has been concerned with reducing the lookup latency by means of proximity neighbour and route selection, but focused on recursive routing algorithms. This work leverages location data about peers and extends Kademlia's iterative routing algorithm to reduce cross-network traffic at the level of the distributed hash table. Evaluation with real-world measurement data gives evidence that locality of traffic tends to reduce lookup latencies as well. In turn, mechanisms that aim at reducing lookup latencies do not necessarily reduce cross-network traffic to the same extent.},
